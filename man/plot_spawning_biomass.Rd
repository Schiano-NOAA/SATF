\title{Plot spawning biomass (SB)}
\usage{
plot_spawning_biomass(
  dat,
  unit_label = "metric ton",
  scale_amount = 1,
  ref_line = c("target", "unfished"),
  end_year = NULL,
  relative = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{

\item{dat}{A path to a file name where the data are stored.}

\item{scale_amount}{indicate the exact amount of scale (i.e. 1000)}

\item{ref_line}{A string specifying the type of reference you want to
compare spawning biomass to. The default is `"target"`, which looks for
`"spawning_biomass_target"` in the `"label"` column of `dat`. The actual
searching in `dat` is case agnostic and will work with either upper- or
lower-case letters but you must use one of the options specified in the
default list to ensure that the label on the figure looks correct
regardless of how it is specified in `dat`.}

\item{end_year}{last year of assessment}

\item{relative}{A logical value specifying if the resulting figures should
be relative spawning biomass. The default is `FALSE`. `ref_line` indicates
which reference point to use.}
}
\value{
Plot spawning biomass from the results of an assessment model translated to
the standard output. The {ggplot2} object is returned for further
modifications if needed.
}
\description{
Plot spawning biomass with a reference line as a dashed line. The figure can
also be made relative to this reference line rather than in absolute units.
